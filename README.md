# EnSyncPortal

The premise of the EnSync Portal to track and manage employees within a company with the added benefit of dynamically pushing out data to an employee's resume with the relevant details of each of his/her assignments or project.

This is the initial scaffolding with a few pieces that are not yet implemented. Soon this project will include an Angular UI that calls the API powered by Entity Framework.

# Done
Angular integration into the project with API powered from Entity Framework. 

# Coming Up
Implement CRUD features

Refactor UI code
